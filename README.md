## What are your primary goals as a human being?

Everything I do is with the three high-level goals of Efficiency, Kindness, and Understanding.  I try very hard not to waste my time or yours;  everything I do and say comes from a place of love (see also "constructive criticism" and the golden rule); and finally am extremely interested in understanding a situation and associated goal before beginning work on anything.

## What do you want us to know about your communication style?

- I am an extremely quick thinker and talker.  However, you don't have to be for us to work together!
- I am straightforward and may have some unsolicited advice, but I try to make sure it is constructive and will try to turn it down a notch if you ask me to.
- I am open to debate on anything. I enjoy thoughtful interaction. Let's learn from eachother!
- I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve.  I'm no good at lying or hiding my feelings.
- My preference in most cases would be for written communication as it gives me time to process and present a coherent, reasoned opinion and address all of your points.  But I love brainstorming over beers too!

## What are some useful things to know in advance about your style?

- I love to help!
- I am generally confident in my opinion, yet also not sure if I'm correct. Please advise me if you know better!  I'm self-deprecating and accepting that there is more in the world than this fool knows :)
- I am a guesser, not an asker (see https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2010/05/askers-vs-guessers/340891/)
- I act like an extrovert - fairly outgoing while in public - but I value my alone/recharge time like an introvert.
- I am generally a happy person.  I am difficult to upset (but I am easily excitable) - and quick to forget past frustrations.

## How can you best work with me?

- The best way to get me to do something is to send a calendar invite.  If I'm not doing it right now or it's not on my calendar, I have already forgotten I planned to do it.
- I like my feedback immediate and unfiltered. Iâ€™m very interested in doing our best work together, and I get over momentary hurt feelings very quickly.
- Efficiency is one of my primary goals.  If it is not your goal on a shared project, that's no problem - but I must ask that you please advise me of that early and often.
- I'm a sucker for bullet lists.

## What are your pet peeves?

- dropped/delayed commitments.  If I have you on the calendar, I expect you to cancel well in advance or to be there when you said you would.  I will do you the same courtesy.
- uncommunicated vision.  This is transparency on steroids.  Explain *why* you think something so I can work with the spirit of your mission.  Teach me to fish!
- unwillingness to question assumptions.  I don't believe the world usually matches our expectations and try not to act on mine.

## What are your self-perceived biggest shortcomings?

- I can be a bit impatient and excitable, particularly if I don't understand your vision.  Feel free to call me out on this.
- I am not very good at noticing subtext, inferring your deeper meaning, or reading between the lines.  Please, give it to me straight!
- I tend to answer the question as it was asked, but not necessarily as it was meant:  "black or white?" "Yes. It is some combination of the two."
- I am not always very self-aware.  If you observe me acting outside of these parameters, I would love to [talk about it!](mailto:gently@gmail.com).  Or you are welcome to [submit a pull request](https://github.com/fool/owners_manual/pulls).
